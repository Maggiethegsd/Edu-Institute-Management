Program Script - Maggiethegsd 2024 

One of the three fundamental scripts of the project.

Simple as it is. Just to run the program itself. Originally it did not exist but later I made the decision to separate
it into it's own script to make other scripts independent of being the program starter and to free them to do their own 
functions.

Starts by loading the Login screen
